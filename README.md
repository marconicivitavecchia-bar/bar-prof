This is a repository created by the teacher as an example for all the other projects of the organization.

This organization is composed of all the students of 5Ainf of the Higher Education School Guglielmo Marconi, Civitavecchia, the year 2018-2019.

# Rationale
This repository is intended to be as simple as possible to teach the design process from brief to web page for all the students. We can think to this repository as a "minimum common denominator" for all the project. In other words, to be able to implement a project like this is the minimum for a sufficient vote.

However, all the students and group are strongly encouraged to go beyond this simple project and create a more rich website on this basis.

# Design and implementation process
We started from [this] brief.

I realized this wireframe:

I cut the elements as following:
